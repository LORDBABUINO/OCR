CP467 Presentation

For each section: -Explain how it works, what we did, why we did it, show examples (show code?)

Filtering (Jesper)
	-High pass
	-Low pass (mean filter)
	-Padding the image (making the sides the same pixel as the other values to improve quality)
	-Convolution

Multiple Characters (Will)
	-Handle several characters in the same file

Thinning: (Jason)
	-Applying Dr. Ahmed's algorithm to thin the image

Scaling: (Will)
	-Find the edges, crop, then resize

Zoning: (Jesper)
	-Divide the image up into quadrants, calculate percentage in each quadrant, output as vector

Character Recognition: (Jason)
	-Finding smallest Euclidean distance to determine what character the image is (compared to all vectors stored in the DB)

Run through the whole OCR: (Will)
	-Display output
	-Ask audience to choose a number to use the OCR on (draw on laptop, then insert)
	-Then use a Letter
	-Explain validation process, how we use it 

Future Outlook: (All)
	-Talk about using grammar rules in the future
	-Everyone talks about one idea they would like to improve on
